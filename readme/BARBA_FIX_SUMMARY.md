# Barba.js Loading Screen Animation Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **CSS Conflicts with GSAP Animation**
**Problem:** The CSS was using `!important` rules that prevented GSAP from controlling the loading screen during transitions.

**Fix:** Modified `dev/css/templates/_loadingscreen.scss`:
- Removed `!important` from `.js-ready .loadingScreen` visibility rules
- Added special CSS rule for `.is-transitioning .loadingScreen` to ensure GSAP can control it
- Disabled CSS transitions during GSAP animations to prevent conflicts

### 2. **GSAP Initial State Issues**
**Problem:** The initial GSAP setup was conflicting with CSS visibility rules.

**Fix:** Updated `dev/js/animation/animBarba.mjs`:
- Removed `autoAlpha: 1` from initial setup to let CSS handle initial visibility
- Added explicit `autoAlpha: 1` in `loaderIn()` function when animation starts
- Added proper reset in `loaderAway()` completion callback

### 3. **Homepage Template Structure Issue**
**Problem:** The homepage template (`app/site/templates/home.php`) had incorrect barba container structure - it was closing the `</body>` tag before calling the footer snippet, which broke the barba container.

**Fix:** Updated `app/site/templates/home.php`:
- Moved the footer snippet call to the correct position
- Ensured proper barba container closure through the footer snippet

### 4. **Enhanced Debugging**
**Added:** Comprehensive console logging to track:
- Barba initialization success
- Transition triggers (leave/enter)
- Animation start/complete events
- Hook execution with URL information

## How the Fix Works

### Initial Page Load
1. CSS shows loading spinner while page loads
2. When JS is ready, CSS hides loading screen
3. Barba is initialized and ready for transitions

### Page Transitions
1. User clicks a navigation link
2. Barba `before` hook adds `is-transitioning` class
3. CSS rule makes loading screen visible and disables CSS transitions
4. `leave` transition calls `loaderIn()` - GSAP animates loading screen in
5. `enter` transition calls `loaderAway()` - GSAP animates loading screen out
6. `after` hook removes `is-transitioning` class

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Check Console Logs**
Open browser dev tools and look for these messages:
```
âœ… Barba.js initialized successfully with loading screen animations
Barba available: true
GSAP available: true
Loading screen element exists: true
```

### 2. **Test Page Transitions**
Navigate between pages using the menu links. You should see:
```
Barba: before hook - transition starting
Barba: leave transition triggered
Barba: loaderIn animation starting
Barba: loaderIn animation complete
Barba: enter transition triggered
Barba: loaderAway animation starting
Barba: loaderAway animation complete
```

### 3. **Visual Verification**
During transitions, you should see:
- Loading screen slides in from left to right (covering the page)
- Loading screen slides out from right to left (revealing new page)
- Smooth GSAP easing animation (power4.inOut)

## Troubleshooting

### If animations still don't work:

1. **Check Barba Container Structure**
   Verify your PHP templates have:
   ```html
   <body data-barba="wrapper">
     <div data-barba="container">
       <!-- page content -->
     </div>
   </body>
   ```

2. **Check Navigation Links**
   Ensure links are regular `<a>` tags (not JavaScript links)
   Links should point to actual pages on your domain

3. **Check CSS Loading**
   Verify the loading screen CSS is being loaded:
   ```css
   .loadingScreen {
     position: fixed;
     width: 100vw;
     height: 200vh;
     background-color: var(--color-bg-darkgray);
     z-index: 99999;
   }
   ```

4. **Check CDN Libraries**
   Verify these are loading in your footer:
   - GSAP: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/gsap.min.js`
   - ScrollTrigger: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/ScrollTrigger.min.js`
   - Barba: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@barba/core`

## Key Changes Made

### CSS Changes (`dev/css/templates/_loadingscreen.scss`)
```css
/* OLD - Conflicted with GSAP */
html.js-ready .loadingScreen {
    visibility: hidden !important;
    opacity: 0 !important;
}

/* NEW - Allows GSAP control */
html.js-ready .loadingScreen {
    visibility: hidden;
    opacity: 0;
}

html.is-transitioning .loadingScreen {
    visibility: visible !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    transition: none !important;
}
```

### JavaScript Changes (`dev/js/animation/animBarba.mjs`)
- Enhanced debugging throughout
- Proper GSAP state management
- Better animation sequencing
- Improved error handling

The loading screen animation should now work properly during page transitions!
